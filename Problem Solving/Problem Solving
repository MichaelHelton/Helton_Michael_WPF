In this situation with the Cat, Parrot and the bag of seeds I will figure out how is the best way to accomplish the goal
by getting each across the river.
Ok, with only enough room for one passenger/item left on the boat you have to think, if I leave the cat with the parrot
the parrot is sure to get eaten. If I leave the parrot with the seeds, the seeds are sure to get eaten.
