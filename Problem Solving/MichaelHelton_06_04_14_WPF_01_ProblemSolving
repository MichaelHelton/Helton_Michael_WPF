In this situation with the Cat, Parrot and the bag of seeds I will figure out how is the best way to accomplish the goal
by getting each across the river.
Ok, with only enough room for one passenger/item left on the boat you have to think, if I leave the cat with the parrot
the parrot is sure to get eaten. If I leave the parrot with the seeds, the seeds are sure to get eaten.
You have to think, how wide is the river? Maybe I can throw the bag of seed across and when it hits the other side it
will bust open and the parrot will fly himself to the other side of the river. That will take care of two and I will
have the cat in the boat with me. If the river is to wide then you could tie the bag of seeds up where the parrot
couldn't get into it. Leave the parrot and bag of seeds, take the cat across and drop him off. Go back and get the seeds
take them across and then back. Get the parrot and the job would be done.
