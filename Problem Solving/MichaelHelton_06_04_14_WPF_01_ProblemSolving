In this situation with the Cat, Parrot and the bag of seeds I will figure out how is the best way to accomplish the goal
by getting each across the river.
Ok, with only enough room for one passenger/item left on the boat you have to think, if I leave the cat with the parrot
the parrot is sure to get eaten. If I leave the parrot with the seeds, the seeds are sure to get eaten.
You have to think, how wide is the river? Maybe I can throw the bag of seed across and when it hits the other side it
will bust open and the parrot will fly himself to the other side of the river. That will take care of two and I will
have the cat in the boat with me. If the river is to wide then you could tie the bag of seeds up where the parrot
couldn't get into it. Leave the parrot and bag of seeds, take the cat across and drop him off. Go back and get the seeds
take them across and then back. Get the parrot and the job would be done.
That would be too easy I would think.


In this scenario with the socks it's real easy with A). All you have to do is grab 1 pair of socks to get a matching
pair. That is if you are like myself and after they come out of the dryer you pair your socks together. If you don't
then there might be a problem. I am going with you are like me and pair the socks.
Now for B) I am going to guess that if you pair the socks you place each sock color into a certain order in the drawer.
If you placed the socks in color order even in the dark you would know where each color would be placed in the drawer.
